<h2>Why you need a hobby?</h2>
<section class="need-hobby">
  <p>
    Hobbies allow you to discover interests outside of work.
    They allow you to be creative and try all sorts of new things.
    If you are bored with your old hobby, choosing another can make your
    creative juices flow again. Don't push yourself, but you have many options, even if your budget is limited.
    It helps to relieve stress by keeping you engaged in something you enjoy. Hobbies give you a way to take your 
    mind off the stresses of everyday life. They let you relax and seek pleasure in activities that aren't 
    associated with work, chores or other responsibilities. Hobbies help you become more patient.

    <h4>Upgrade on your current interests</h4>
    <p>
      See what interests you. Investigate what your free time takes when you have it.
      Do you like reading books? You may want to try to write them. Do you like cold beer at
      the end of the day? Maybe your hobby may be trying to brew beer at home. Turn what you
      already love into a hobby.
    </p>
    <h4>Viewing your childhood</h4>
    <p>Remember what you loved as a child. Did you like racing bikes with friends? Did you
      really do comics? Did you like to paint or paint? Think about what really excited you as a child and what
      you could spend for hours</p>
    <h4>Exploring new territory for ideas</h4>
    <p> Visit a craft store. Take a walk around the craft store to see what hobbies are
      available.
      You can find something you have never thought about, such as building airplanes or
      learning how to work with clay.</p>

<h2>Advices</h2>
<section class="advices">
  <div class="info">
    <p>
      Before you get involved in your hobby, find a place to work on it and a place to store it,
      whether indoors or outdoors. Even outdoor hobbies that need equipment will require storage space;
      these hockey sticks, soccer balls, boots, bikes and tents have to go somewhere when you are not
      using them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buy used consumables, which is more environmentally friendly and saves you money. You can
      find some used consumables in savings stores and online exchanges.
    </p>
    <p>
      After practicing a hobby for a while, you will become better at it. You can get to a
      point where the hobby can pay off. For example, this can lead to selling arts and crafts, training other
      athletes, writing articles, and training others, which is a good way to keep costs low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try three times a few times and see what you like. Your first experience may not be
      representative!
