<h2 class="needHobby">Why you need a hobby?</h2>

<section>
  <div class="info">
    <p> Hobbies allow you to discover interests outside of work.
      They allow you to be creative and try all sorts of new things.
      If you are bored with your old hobby, choosing another can make your
      creative juices flow again. Don't push yourself, but you have many options, even if your budget is limited.

        <p>Before you get involved in your hobby, find a place to work on it and a place to store it,
          whether indoors or outdoors. Even outdoor hobbies that need equipment will require storage space;
          these hockey sticks, soccer balls, boots, bikes and tents have to go somewhere when you are not
          using them.</p>

        <span matListItemTitle>2</span>
        <span matListItemLine>Buy used consumables, which is more environmentally friendly and saves you money. You can

        <span matListItemLine> After practicing a hobby for a while, you will become better at it. You can get to a
          point
          where the hobby can pay off. For example, this can lead to selling arts and crafts, training other
          athletes, writing articles, and training others, which is a good way to keep costs low.</span>
